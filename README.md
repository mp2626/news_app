# Web News

To provide access to news on the go in a simple clean format via a web application that targets mobile users first.

# User Story

AS a professional who commutes for work and has a keen interest in keeping up with the latest news and weather.

I WANT to be able to access the news and weather on my mobile in a simple clean uncomplicated format.

SO THAT I can see the weather for the day, review the day’s top stories, and if i have additional time, search for articles of my choosing.


# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that I have opened the app.
THEN I’m presented with today’s 4 top stories and weather forecast – Icon, Temp and wind.

WHEN I search for a news article.
THEN the page refreshes and I’m presented with the 4 top articles for my search term.

WHEN I search for a news article.
THEN that search is saved as a quick access open on the screen.

WHEN I click the Top Stories Button.
THEN then page refreshes, and cycles through the top stories so that I can navigate away from my search results.
